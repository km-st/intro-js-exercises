/*
  An application can break when errors are encountered within the code.
  Exception handling is a process that deals with these errors in a 
  predictable manner so that when something does go wrong your app
  has code in place such as a try catch statement to handle said error
  as opposed to it potentially breaking your app or causing unpredictable
  behavioru. An example could be when fetching data from an api, use a 
  try catch statement and trigger a toast notification to handle error
  state
